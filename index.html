    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Armando Bugarin and I am originally from Denver, CO. Currently I live in Kirkland, WA, and prior to moving out here I lived in Las Vegas for a year. I am married and have a little dog named Ramses.</p>
    
    <p>My previous job experience was as a real estate agent.
        This was in Denver and I specialized working as a buyers agent.
        As a real estate agent I was responsible for generating my own business everyday.
        I was in the business for a little over 3 years, and in that time I was able to help many families achieve their dream of buying a home.</p>
    
    <p>I have a B.S. in biology degree from Metropolitan State University of Denver, as well as 2 associate's degrees.</p>

    <p>My goal professionally is to become a software engineer. That will give me the opportunity to take care of me and my wife.
        I have always been into tech so it is a desire to make my way into the industry.
        Personally, my goal is to travel to as many countries as possible. I've been to 8 countries so far, so hopefully many more to come.
        Another goal is to learn to play the guitar and piano.</p>
